### New Features

#### Bookmarks tags

We've introduced a helpful new feature to improve discoverability and ease your technology tracking: **bookmark tags**.

Now, when editing a bookmark, you can assign up to two tags from a provided list. Using AI, future bookmarks will automatically receive relevant tags, saving your time.

On the Discover page, you'll spot trending tags. Click any tag to explore related bookmarks, a great way to stay updated on specific topics. Go to the [discover page](https://digest.club/discover) to try it out!

To search for a specific tag, head to the dedicated tags page for your topic.. For instance, if you want to see all the bookmarks with the tag **javascript**, go to [https://digest.club/tags/javascript](https://digest.club/tags/javascript).
