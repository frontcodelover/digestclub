### New Feature

- **Tweet / X Embeds**: We are introducing the ability to display tweets in an "embed" format within a Digest! When editing a Digest, click on the ellipsis icon of the tweet's block and select the "Tweet" option from the block style. This feature is only available for tweet bookmark.

### Enhancements

- **Default Image for URLs**: Bookmarks without open-graph images will now display a default image with the site's title and favicon. This enhancement ensures a visually consistent experience for your content.

- **Performance Improvements**: We've implemented several performance enhancements on the page displaying a team's Digests, ensuring faster load times.

### Bug Fixes

- **Twitter Link Import Bug Fix**: We've resolved the bug that was previously blocking the import of Twitter links.

- **Various Bug Fixes**: We've addressed various bugs and issues throughout the application, ensuring a more stable and reliable experience.
